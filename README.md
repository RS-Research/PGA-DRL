# PGA-DRL: Progressive Graph Attention-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to the official repository for **PGA-DRL**, a novel model integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) within a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework to enhance recommender systems. This repository provides the code implementation and supporting materials for the research paper:

**"PGA-DRL: Progressive Graph Attention-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems"**

## Features
- Progressive fusion of GCN and GAT embeddings for enhanced global and local user-item interaction representation.
- Actor-Critic framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction.
- Scalable and efficient implementation suitable for large-scale datasets.
- Evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets with state-of-the-art results.
